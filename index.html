                    <h2>What is my Motivation?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've chosen to study ICT at HZ University with the main reason being, gaining enough study
                        points, in hopefully the first
                        year. Because then I'll have the choice to go study English Language and Culture at the
                        University of Utrecht.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, I do take a lot of interest in programming, coding, digital design, game
                        develepment and the English
                        Language. The latter being why I, as a native Dutch speaker, preferred to be placed in the
                        international class at HZ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First of all, I choose this course to learn the basics of
                        programming for a first year ICT-student. And second of all, because of the block focussing on
                        game development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, having started my first year, I wonder how the other blocks will be, since my interest
                        has been piqued.
                        After a gap year, I have been ready as ever to start studying again. This clearly proves a part
                        of my
                        motivation being just learning.

                    <h2>Why ICT?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I need to start my dream somewhere. And if it isn't at the beginning of the end, it shall be
                        from
                        zero to one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I applied to ICT with the main thought being, that I need to start somewhere.
                        In the end I want to create something beautiful, inside and out, something timeless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I gain some of my happiness from solving problems and achieving progress. Society evolves and
                        methods
                        improve, this means there will always be something new to learn and for me to be happy doing
                        what I
                        love.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With ICT I do not only start the journey towards my dream job, which truth be told is still
                        unclear,
                        I also learn the basics. Learning is a process of trial and error, which starts somewhere and
                        will
                        inevitably end. But until then, I want to keep creating.
