                    <h3>Part-time job</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I have a part-time job on saturdays and thursday evenings at a flower shop near my
                        neighbourhood.
                        They're very flexible and considerate, which makes it easy to combine with school.
                        I enjoy working there a lot, thus it feels more like a hobby.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my spare time I am a homebody, unless I meet up with friends.
                        <br>
                        I enjoy the company of my own room a lot, in which I spend a lot of time enjoying and or doing
                        the
                        arts and crafts;
                        <br>
                        I watch movies and series in my personal cinema, called a dark bedroom and a projector;
                        <br>
                        In the past couple of years I've found myself enjoying fiction books a lot, which differ from
                        thrillers to fantasy and most of them are Young-Adult like myself;
                        <br>
                        My imagination goes beyond the skull of my head into Google Drive documents, when it comes to
                        writing stories of my own, yet unpublished;
                        <br>
                        You'd seldom see me by myself without music blasting in my ears, so I'd like to take this moment
                        to
                        brag about my fantastic
                        <a href="spotify:track:4cOdK2wGLETKBW3PvgPWqT?context=spotify%3Aplaylist%3A0LiFteH1eNhRQzQ8FVa3tE"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a> Playlists;
                        <br>
                        Like most of my family, I have a talent for drawing and crafting, which come in handy when we do
                        not
                        only have to be creative but also artistic.
                    </p>
                    <h3>“I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn.”</h3>
                    <h4>-Sansa Stark from the series Game of Thrones</h4>
                    <p>
                        Although these first weeks of school are a whole lot different than my prior care free gap-year,
                        programming,
                        however unfamiliar I was with it, has been an interest of mine for a long time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because I am a very curious soul, I want to know how everything simply exists.
                        It's not all simple though, which I came to understand when I first had to start reading
                        literature at school.
                        <br>
                        Language based subjects overall were dificult for me, a girl who understands bèta-subjects more
                        easily.
                        It took me some years to even get a grip on technical reading in Dutch, my mother language, let
                        alone in English, but I learned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is no seceret that programming has many languages of it's own.
                        But unlike the emediate dislike I have at first for most things which I cannot learn quickly,
                        as long as it is an interest of mine, keeps me occupied, and gives me serotonin when I work out
                        its problems,
                        <br>
                        I'm 99 percent sure my love-hate relationship with programming will blossom just like it has
                        with literature.
                        But lets keep that one percent for improvement, shall we?
