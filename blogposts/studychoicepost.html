      <h1>Study Choice</h1>
      <article class="questionans">
        <h2>Should she Stay or Should she Go? Steady, As She doesn't go, There She Goes</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Study choice activities</h3>
        <p>
          For ICT of HZ University I went to the open day and have participated in the student-for-a-day
          program.
          I've done the same for the bachelor 'Bouwkunde' of HZ University and I've participated in
          various online
          open days, while I was a fourth and fifth year in Highschool, Art Schools and to orientate with
          other studies.
        </p>
        <h3>Motivate your study choice</h3>
        <p>
          I've chosen to study ICT at HZ University mostly to gain enough study points,
          in hopefully the first year, to have the choice to go study English Language and Culture at the
          University of Utrecht.
          However I have also taken a liking in Game development at BUAS.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second would be obvious to switch to after ICT at HZ, and is my first choice to switch to if
          I get accepted.
          I do take a lot of interest in programming, digital design, game develepment and the English
          Language.
          <br>
          The latter being why I, as a native Dutch speaker, prefer to be placed in the international
          class when that's possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose this course not only to learn the basics of programming for a first year ICT, but also
          because of the block focussing on game development.
          <br>
          I am highly motivated for the upcoming school year and ready as ever, after a gap year, to start
          studying again.
        </p>
        <h3>After completing the study</h3>
        <p>
          As I stated above, I'm planning on switching after my first year or after gaining the required
          amount of study points.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not centain yet which exact profession I'll end up loving,
          but I am sure I either want a job in the film industry, for either screan writing or related to
          the digital design,
          or in publising, considering my hobby of reading and writing for fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the study, I expect to learn programming and gain a sufficient amount of knowledge about
          game development.
          <br>
          Furthermore I'd like my English language to improve, being surrounded by international students.
          And I am exited to get to know a lot more of people and make great friends the following year!
