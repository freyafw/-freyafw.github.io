        <h2>Proof that Feedback c√°n be nicely worded</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Given Feedback under the name of Daphne Heertjes</h3>
        <p>
          Hi Freya,
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to our program!
          <br>
          So your in for the first year and continue on
          to University. Although we did not have many students who have done that with us. Keep in mind
          that it might be
          challenging to keep your motivation up in group work knowing you want to continue on to
          university and the rest of the group members
          have different ideas about their study (or lack motivation).
          So I would advise you to align with motivated students in a group as to achieve study succes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would also advice to gain knowledge on both fields. English
          study versus media ICT so you can make a well informed decision which way you would like to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not offer much wihtin the creative Media game technologies in our program. So maybe it
          would also make sense to check the college program in Breda, I believe, which is more focused on
          ICT and media than we are. Just keep in mind that most of our program is about coding.
          <br>We do
          offer the
          international program and we are going to build a game so two of the elements you are looking
          for will be given.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly having your study plan set I can also advise you to sign yourself up at the beginning of
          the schoolyear for the IT personality project weeks
          since those study point are often forgotten and you are in for obtaining your propedeutic
          certificate in the first year.
          <br>
          Having a set plan in place and remaining disciplined is what will help your though!
        </p>
        <h3>Thoughts?</h3>
        <p>
          I was taken aback by the nice tone the feedback was given in, although it mostly consisted of
          advice.
          <br>
          After I had read it, this was before starting the HZ ICT program, I took a deep dive into the
          Creative Media Game Technologies program in Breda,
          and took my chances, I sent out an email. I got the information I needed from BUAS, and came to
          the conclusion I'd either switch to the program BUAS offers, if I get accepted,
          or the remaining contestant, English Language and Culture on the University of Utrecht, when I
          finish my propaedeutic year at HZ HBO-ICT.
          <br>
          The struggle to stay disciplined will determine wether or not I'll achieve my goal, but being
          surrounded with likewise interested students,
          I have doubt my motivation will disappear this year.
