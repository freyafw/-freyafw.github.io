      <h1>Three Interesting Companies</h1>
      <article class="questionans">
        <h2>Google</h2>
        <p>
          Googlers work in teams in business strategy, design, finance, engineering and technology, marketing and
          communications, and sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google uses 216 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery.
          The IT technology Google is actively using are three technologies for its website. These include HSTS, GStatic
          Google Static Content, and QUIC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google's pace of hiring was also torrid in the second quarter of 2022 as the company added 10,000 new
          employees to its 163,906 workforce, up 17 percent year over year. For the rest of 2022, however, Google will
          focus hiring on engineering, technical and other crucial roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          They're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including distributed computing,
          large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, UI design and
          mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day.
          They want their engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new
          problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.
          <br>
          Google has their global headquarters in California and has more than 70 offices in 50 countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like google because out of the search engins there are, I find google to be the most aesthetically pleasing,
          and foremost the easiest to use, making searching for information clear and fast.
          <br>
          I'd like to work on the improvement of this clear design from the fundamentals of programming.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>NOS</h2>
        <p>
          While NOS is a Dutch television program, it combines my interest of writing, as a journalist and creating film
          media. Television broadcast companies need IT specialists and programmers on the dayly, not only to work with
          the filming but also for their websites and other media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the NOS is only located in the Netherlands, the amount of people working there is just above 600.
          <br>
          Working at the biggest news broadcast company in the Netherlands, means there are many possibilities to work
          there, but as a programmer it's rather logical to work in the film industry side or the webmedia side of NOS.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Nintendo</h2>
        <p>
          Nintendo has headquearters around the globe up until twelve different countries. Nintendo had a total number
          of 6,574 employees in its 2021 fiscal year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nintendo Platform Technology Development is Nintendo's Hardware division. It was formed in 2015 with Company
          President Tatsumi Kimishima combining Nintendo Integrated Research and Development with Nintendo System
          Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nintendo Software Design & Development has developed numerous products for the Wii and Nintendo DS ranging
          from the Wii channels to Photo Dojo on DSiWare.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nintendo Software Planning and Development's main purpose was to assist other developers in creating Nintendo
          published video games, though they themselves also develop original titles. They were consolidated into
          Nintendo EPD with EAD.
          <br>
          It's possible to work in these groups as an IT specialist or programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nintendo Switch system software (also known by its codename Horizon) is an updatable firmware and
          operating system used by the Nintendo Switch video game console. It is based on a proprietary microkernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nintendo nurtures their relationship-focused culture with compassion, sincerity, humility and honest
          communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nintendo is an IT-company, and it's famous for their games. I've grown up playing on nintendo products and
          still remember the moment I walked into the game store and was allowed to buy one. PLaying on the WII and
          Nintendo Switch, I've grown very fond of playing games on them and if I end up in the Game Developmet
          industry, it would be a dream come true to work at a fun and worldwide company as Nintendo.
