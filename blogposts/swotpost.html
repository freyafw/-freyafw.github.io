      <h1>Personal SWOT Analysis</h1>
      <article class="questionans">
        <h2>Focus on the shortcommings and you'll overlook the strengths</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Strengths: What do you do best? What are your positive
          traits?</h3>
        <p>
          Creative Thinking;
          <br>
          I grew up in a naturally artistic family and the trait didn't skip out on me,
          because I enjoy drawing a lot in my spare time.
          This trait often gives me an authentic point of view and I find myself brainstorming on uncommon
          ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Anticipate;
          <br>
          I relatively find it easy to find connections based on context.
          In other words I am quick to find a way to compromise and thus to solve problems.
          <br>
          Maths has always been a strong subject of mine and although it's not necessary for ICT,
          it's a clear example that I'm good at problem solving.
          Another is a different hobby of mine being sailing. Being on a small sailboat,
          you need some quick thinking for every aspect of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Adjust; 
          <br>
          I've come to know at my part-time job that I'm easy to adjust to my surroundings and
          work,
          since, working at a garden centre and its florist shop,
          I've been put on various tasks and multiple at a time, succeeding and finishing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being Assertive at times in my case means taking initiative and listening to others attentively.
          It's showing when I'm working on projects which I enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, I am quite critical when it comes to judging my own work and if asked of that of
          others.
          <br>
          I'm also a pretty fast learner, which means when it's shown it doesn't take me much practice to
          understand and do.
        </p>
        <h3>Weaknesses: What personality traits may be holding you
          back in your studies/career?</h3>
        <p>
        <p>
          Because I'm pretty Assertive, I don't have much difficulty showing my vulnerable side when I
          have to.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this makes me straight forward to some people and over the years has made me into an
          anxious person
          rather than very social. Nevertheless, I am an open book and sum it down to being a socially
          awkward social butterfly. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking in front of a crowd is thus a hard thing for me to do. Being a critical thinker can
          make me
          overthink my ability to perform to the point I'm telling myself it has to be perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a perfectionist is my biggest weakness at this point in my life if I may say so.
          This comes down to me taking criticism to heart and so it takes some time for me to see past it
          and learn
          from my mistakes. Often I force myself to do it again
          but perfectly and never wrong again, but I know that's not what time and learning is about.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>Opportunities: How can you turn your strengths/weaknesses into opportunities?</h3>
        <p>
          In my eighteen years of living, most of my weaknesses have become strengths for me already,
          or I've come to terms with them. 
          <br>
          The opportunities I see laying beyond are learning to take
          criticism well and being less nervous while speaking to a crowd.
          It's not that I'm bad at them at all, I'd just like to improve regarding them.
        </p>
        <h3>Threats: What obstacles do you face to succeed as a
          student? Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from
          succeeding in your studies/career?</h3>
        <p>
          The obvious threat is that I'm going to put too much pressure on myself,
          because I don't want to make mistakes and will do my best to avoid making them.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, what I've learned is that making mistakes is fine as long as you learn from them.
          And I'd like to be remembered even when I do eventually make mistakes.
          <br>
          Even though I'm very aware of my own take on this,
          I still see it as a threat which I'll be grateful to stop being scared of.
