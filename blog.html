                        Without a doubt, it seems to be a very controversial topic in the IT community. The answer
                        however is quit simple. The section element should come before the article element, purely
                        because of it's meaning. It is true these two element can be switched in the code and no
                        difference can be seen, however to end this discussion we should take a look at their
                        definitions. Article: 'A piece of writing included with others in a newspaper, magazine, or
                        other publication'.
                        Section: 'A thematic grouping of content.' Conclusion, there can be multiple articles within a
                        section, a section in an article is a list.

                    <h2>Study choice activities</h2>
                    <p>
                        For ICT of HZ University I went to the open day and have participated in the student-for-a-day
                        program.
                        I've done the same for the bachelor 'Bouwkunde' of HZ University and I've participated in
                        various online
                        open days, while I was a fourth and fifth year in Highschool, Art Schools and to orientate with
                        other studies.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Motivate your study choice</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've chosen to study ICT at HZ University mostly to gain enough study points,
                        in hopefully the first year, to have the choice to go study English Language and Culture at the
                        University of Utrecht.
                        However, I've also taken the liking in the study Creative Media and Game Technologies at BUAS
                        (Breda).
                        The second would be obvious to switch to after ICT at HZ, and is my first choice to switch to if
                        I get accepted.
                        I do take a lot of interest in programming, digital design, game develepment and the English
                        Language.
                        The latter being why I, as a native Dutch speaker, prefer to be placed in the international
                        class when that's possible.
                        I chose this course not only to learn the basics of programming for a first year ICT, but also
                        because of the block focussing on game development.
                        I am highly motivated for the upcoming school year and ready as ever, after a gap year, to start
                        studying again.
                    </p>
                    <h2>After completing the study</h2>
                    <p>
                        As I stated above, I'm planning on switching after my first year or after gaining the required
                        amount of study points.
                        I am not centain which exact profession I'll end up loving,
                        but I am sure I either want a job in the film industry, for either screan writing or related to
                        the digital design,
                        or in publising, considering my hobby of reading and writing for fun.
                        During the study, I expect to learn programming and gain a sufficient amount of knowledge about
                        game development.
                        Furthermore I'd like my English language to improve, being surrounded by international students.
                        And I am exited to get to know a lot more of people and make great friends the following year!

            <article class="questionans">
                <h3>Focus on the shortcommings and you'll overlook the strengths</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>...read more</summary>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Strengths What do you do best? What are your positive
                        traits?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Creative Thinking; I grew up in a naturally artistic family and the trait didn't skip out on me,
                        because I enjoy drawing a lot in my spare time.
                        This trait often gives me an authentic point of view and I find myself brainstorming on uncommon
                        ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To Anticipate; I relatively find it easy to find connections based on context.
                        In other words I am quick to find a way to compromise and thus to solve problems.
                        Maths has always been a strong subject of mine and although it's not necessary for ICT,
                        it's a clear example that I'm good at problem solving.
                        Another is a different hobby of mine being sailing. Being on a small sailboat,
                        you need some quick thinking for every aspect of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To Adjust; I've come to know at my part-time job that I'm easy to adjust to my surroundings and
                        work,
                        since, working at a garden centre and its florist shop,
                        I've been put on various tasks and multiple at a time, succeeding and finishing them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being Assertive at times in my case means taking initiative and listening to others attentively.
                        It's showing when I'm working on projects which I enjoy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I am quite critical when it comes to judging my own work and if asked of that of
                        others.
                        I'm also a pretty fast learner, which means when it's shown it doesn't take me much practice to
                        understand and do
                    </p>
                    <h2>Weaknesses What personality traits may be holding you
                        back in your studies / career?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Because I'm pretty Assertive, I don't have much difficulty showing my vulnerable side when I
                        have to.
                        However, this makes me straight forward to some people and over the years has made me into an
                        anxious person
                        rather than very social. Nevertheless, I am an open book and sum it down to being a socially
                        awkward social butterfly.
                        Speaking in front of a crowd is thus a hard thing for me to do. Being a critical thinker can
                        make me
                        overthink my ability to perform to the point I'm telling myself it has to be perfect.
                        A perfectionist is my biggest weakness at this point in my life if I may say so.
                        This comes down to me taking criticism to heart and so it takes some time for me to see past it
                        and learn
                        from my mistakes. Often I force myself to do it again
                        but perfectly and never wrong again, but I know that's not what time and learning is about.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Opportunities How can you turn your strengths /
                        weaknesses into opportunities?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In my eighteen years of living, most of my weaknesses have become strengths for me already,
                        or I've come to terms with them. The opportunities I see laying beyond are learning to take
                        criticism well and being less nervous while speaking to a crowd.
                        It's not that I'm bad at them at all, I'd just like to improve regarding them.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Threats What obstacles do you face to succeed as a
                        student? Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from
                        succeeding in your studies / career?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The obvious threat is that I'm going to put too much pressure on myself,
                        because I don't want to make mistakes and will do my best to avoid making them.
                        However, what I've learned is that making mistakes is fine as long as you learn from them.
                        And I'd like to be remembered even when I do eventually make mistakes.
                        Even though I'm very aware of my own take on this,
                        I still see it as a threat which I'll be grateful to stop being scared of.

                        Hi Freya,
                        Welcome to our program! So your in for the first year and continue on
                        to University. Although we did not have many students who have done that with us. Keep in mind
                        that it might be
                        challenging to keep your motivation up in group work knowing you want to continue on to
                        university and the rest of the group members
                        have different ideas about their study (or lack motivation)
                        So I would advise you to align with motivated students in a group as to achieve study succes.
                        I would also advice to gain knowledge on both fields. English
                        study versus media ICT so you can make a well informed decision which way you would like to go.
                        We do not offer much wihtin the creative Media game technologies in our program. So maybe it
                        would also make sense to check the college program in Breda, I believe, which is more focused on
                        ICT and media than we are. Just keep in mind that most of our program is about coding. We do
                        offer the
                        international program and we are going to build a game so two of the elements you are looking
                        for will be given.
                        Lastly having your study plan set I can also advise you to sign yourself up at the beginning of
                        the schoolyear for the IT personality project weeks
                        since those study point are often forgotten and you are in for obtaining your propedeutic
                        certificate in the first year.
                        Having a set plan in place and remaining disciplined is what will help your though!

                    <h2>Thoughts?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was taken aback by the nice tone the feedback was given in, although it mostly consisted of
                        advice.
                        After I had read it, this was before starting the HZ ICT program, I took a deep dive into the
                        Creative Media Game Technologies program in Breda,
                        and took my chances, I sent out an email. I got the information I needed from BUAS, and came to
                        the conclusion I'd either switch to the program BUAS offers, if I get accepted,
                        or the remaining contestant, English Language and Culture on the University of Utrecht, when I
                        finish my propaedeutic year at HZ HBO-ICT.
                        The struggle to stay disciplined will determine wether or not I'll achieve my goal, but being
                        surrounded with likewise interested students,
                        I have doubt my motivation will disappear this year.
